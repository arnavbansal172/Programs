//You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only. Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
//For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
//Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer. A leaf node is a node with no children.
//Sample Input:
//3
//1 2 3
//Sample Output:
//25
//Explanation;
//The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
//The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
//Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
//Input (stdin)
//4 9 0 5 1
//Output (stdout)
//1026
