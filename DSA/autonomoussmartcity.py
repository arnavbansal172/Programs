#In a smart city, an autonomous emergency vehicle (AEV) is positioned in a grid-like city map represented as a 2D integer array grid of size m * n. Each cell in the grid has one of three values:
#• 0 represents a road,
#• 1 represents an area on fire,
#• 2 represents a building that neither the AEV nor the fire can pass through.
#The AEV starts at the top-left corner of the city grid at cell (0, 0), and its objective is to reach the safehouse located at the bottom-right corner of the grid at cell
#(m - 1, n - 1). Each minute, the AEV can move to an adjacent road cell. Simultaneously, fire spreads to all adjacent cells that are roads.
#Your task is to determine the maximum number of minutes the AEV can wait in its initial position before movina whilo etill haina ablata racinh the orifoharica
